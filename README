Note:
Manual Configuration
    Since the sample memory traces are generated without considering allocating to individual rank and bank, 
    the user must manually reconfigure the address location in the AddressMapping class.
    The configuration is done through MAKEFILE compile options

    1. Interleaved controller (AMC, RTMem, PMC)
        Normal translation based on the defined bits order
            Disable all privatization options

    2. Single rank bank privatized controller (ORP, DCmc, MAG, PipeCAS, ReOrder)
        After normal translation, change the bank to match requestor ID. 
        This ensures that each requestor is isolated
            Enable -DSINGLE_RANK_BANK_PRIVATIZATION

    2. Multiple Rank Bank Privatized Controller (ROC, MCMC)
        After normal translation, change the rank and bank accordingly based on the requestor ID.
        This ensures that each requestor is allocated to isolated rank and bank
            Enable -DMULTI_RANK_BANK_PRIVATIZATION

The requestor criticality also requires manual assignment in the main.cpp, as well as request size
    Exmaple: for each requestor, there are three parameters
        bool inOrder = true;        // If the requestor is executing memory request in order
        bool isHRT = true;          // If the requestor is more critical than the others
        int requestSize = 64;       // Size of the memory request
